ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sanjays-escaping-ordinary-coding01

Being an inquisitive philomath, interested to devise extremely targeted techniques for assimilating, scrutinising, and coalescing problems with data.

- Iâ€™m interested in Statistical Analytics, Data management and modeling, Machine Learning, Image Processing, Data Analysis, Backend Stack, Cross-Platform Mobile Application, and Client-Side Web Technology Stack. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning. 
- I'm amalgamating my recent works distributed across multiple NAS. So please spare my current unorganised repos related to university. 
- My next project is to share knowledge and experience of escaping ordinary coding from start.
